# 💳 Payment API

The **Payment API** is a .NET 8 Web API designed to handle payment processing in a distributed microservices system. It communicates with the Order API using RabbitMQ and participates in the **Saga Pattern (Choreography-based)**.

---

### 🔧 Tech Stack:

- .NET 8  
- Clean Architecture  
- MediatR (CQRS)  
- Entity Framework Core  
- PostgreSQL  
- MassTransit + RabbitMQ  

---

### 🧩 Responsibilities:

- Listens for `OrderCreatedEvent` from RabbitMQ  
- Executes payment logic via command handler  
- Persists payment data to PostgreSQL  
- Publishes either:  
  - `PaymentSucceededEvent` (if payment is successful)  
  - `PaymentFailedEvent` (if something goes wrong)  

---

### 🔄 Saga Integration:

This service participates in a **Saga Choreography** flow by reacting to events instead of relying on a central orchestrator. It operates autonomously but contributes to a larger business transaction flow.

---

### 🚀 Event Flow:

1. `OrderCreatedEvent` is published by Order API  
2. Payment API consumes the event and processes the payment  
3. Payment API publishes either:  
   - `PaymentSucceededEvent` → triggers Order confirmation  
   - `PaymentFailedEvent` → triggers Order cancellation

### 🐇 Running RabbitMQ Locally (Docker)

Use the following command to spin up RabbitMQ locally with the management UI:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --hostname rabbit-local \
  --name rabbitmq \
  -p 5672:5672 \
  -p 15672:15672 \
  -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest \
  -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest \
  rabbitmq:3-management
```

- Visit the UI at: [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)  
- Login: `guest` / `guest`

### 🧠 What is the Saga Pattern?
The Saga Pattern is a design pattern used to manage distributed transactions across multiple microservices without using a traditional ACID (atomic) transaction.

Instead of locking resources across services (which doesn't scale), a Saga breaks the process into a sequence of local transactions, each followed by a compensating action (in case something goes wrong).

---
### ✅Why Use the Saga Pattern?
🚀 Because in microservices:
Distributed transactions are hard (no shared DB, no 2-phase commit)

You need to keep data eventually consistent

Services should be loosely coupled

---
### ✨ Benefits:
Enables resilient, scalable workflows

Maintains consistency across services

Allows for rollback using compensating actions

Encourages event-driven architecture

---
### 📍 When to Use the Saga Pattern?
You should consider using the Saga Pattern when:

✅ Use it when:
You have long-running transactions across multiple services

You need eventual consistency (not immediate consistency)

You want to avoid using distributed locks or 2PC

Your business process can be broken into steps

---
### ❌ Avoid when:
You need strong consistency immediately (e.g., banking core balances)

The process is short-lived and can be handled in a single service

Operations cannot be rolled back (and no compensation is possible)
---
### 🧩 Example Scenario
Let's say you have an e-commerce flow:

Create Order

Reserve Inventory

Charge Payment

With the Saga Pattern:

Each step is a local transaction

If Step 3 fails (payment), you compensate Step 2 (release inventory), and maybe cancel the order

---
### 🧱 Types of Sagas
Type	Description
Orchestration	One central service tells others what to do
Choreography	Services react to events and coordinate via messaging (MassTransit supports this well)

---
### ✅ Summary: What / Why / When
Question	Answer
What?	A pattern for managing distributed workflows with local transactions and compensation
Why?	Ensures consistency across microservices without using distributed transactions
When?	Use when your process spans multiple services and can tolerate eventual consistency
